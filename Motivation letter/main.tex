In response to the courses and programs advertised at the institute website, enclosed is my r{\'e}sum{\'e} for the application of the Joint AWI-SAHFOS summer school, which entitled ``The importance of time series observations for the assessment of the biological and societal impacts of climate change". This summer school is a great opportunity for me to gain precious experience for my PhD research.  \linebreak\newline
My main research objective is to investigate the annual microphytobenthic production and explain my observation throughout the year. I have measured the chlorophyll fluorescence and carbohydrate production of benthic microalgae fortnightly for six months and finishing my field sampling on January 2015. I am planning to produce my time series results with R, the programming tool which I am learning now from time to time.  \linebreak\newline
This summer school workshop will greatly benefit me as it covers all the topics that are important to my research study, from experimental design, to data management, and then visualising the results with the most appropriate approach. This will also be a great opportunity for me to interact with experts and other students who attend the workshop. There will be much more than I could learn from the workshop too.  \linebreak\newline
I have an introductory knowledge to R and python as programming tools. I also use R as my main results plotting and data analysis tool. Hence, this workshop will definitely boost my skills with R as programming tool even further and equip myself as a better scientist.  \linebreak\newline
Enclosed is my r{\'e}sum{\'e} to provide you with more details of my skills, accomplishments and experience. I do wish that my application will be approved and so I can gain much more knowledge during my PhD study.  \linebreak\newline
Thank you for your time and consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any enquiries. \linebreak\newline
